# News API Project

Welcome to the News API! This API allows you to access articles, comments, users and topic databases - the full list of available endpoints incl. their descriptions and expected outcomes can be found in the endpoints.json file in the top level of the directory.

In order to connect to the databases locally, add two .env.<name> files containing PGDATABASE=<database_name> (database names can be found in the setup.sql file) and make sure to run the command 'npm i dotenv' to make this work.
